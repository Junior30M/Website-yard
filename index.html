    <p id= "para1">Photon processes are invoked in explaining the photo-fragmentation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a light-based therapeutic technique
        that shows great promise for the selective treatment of a
        variety of cancers and non-malignant conditions.1 The principle
        of PDT is that highly localised destruction of tumours,
        diseased tissue or pathogenic organisms is achieved with light
        following the administration of a light-activated photosensitising
        drug or photosensitiser. This generates various cytotoxic
        reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen that can interact
        with and damage cellular components, leading to cell death.
        Many photosensitisers have been developed and have received
        approval or clinical trials for use in the treatment of cancer,2
        age-related macular degeneration,3 pre-cancerous conditions
        such as Barret’s oesphagus, and oral sterilisation in dental
        procedures. Among these, porphyrins and other tetrapyrrolerelated
        compounds remain the broadest class of compound
        under study for PDT and other light-based therapies </p>
